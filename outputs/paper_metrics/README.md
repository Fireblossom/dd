## Paper-aligned metrics (lightweight)

This folder contains small, human-readable metric files that map paper-reported numbers to checkpoint evaluation outputs.

- `belonging_criteria_checkpoints.json`: sources for the multi-label Belonging Criteria table.

The full checkpoints / prediction dumps are not shipped and are kept under `archive/` locally.
