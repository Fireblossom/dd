A. Criteria for Urban Residents' Recognition of "Local" Identity

1. Objective Criteria
Judgment Guideline: Can it be verified through archives, documents, or quantifiable facts, without involving personal feelings or social evaluation?

●1.1 Current Residence (Individual Life Course)
○Refers only to the individual's current place of residence ("if you're here, you're a local").

●1.2 Birth and Upbringing (Individual Life Course)
○Covers the individual's life trajectory and experiences.

●1.3 Administrative or Legal Recognition (Administrative Identity)
○Covers identity and qualifications granted by government or official institutions.
○Includes: household registration location (hukou), ID number.

●1.4 Family Heritage (Family History & Heritage)
○Covers the individual's family and ancestral historical roots and heritage.
○Includes: parents'/grandparents' experiences, number of generations the family has been settled locally.

●1.5 Assets and Rights (Assets & Entitlements)
○Covers economic assets and rights directly related to the locality.
○Includes: property, land, village collective dividend rights.

●1.6 Intra-city Geographical Boundary (Intra-city Geographical Boundary)
○Distinction Note: Unlike "1.1 Current Residence," this category does not mean "living in/settling in the locality," but rather emphasizes "using an intra-city boundary as the threshold for being considered a local." Whether one crosses this "line" (spatial boundary) itself determines identity, regardless of long-term residence, household registration, family/assets, etc.
○Key Judgment Points (must satisfy both "boundary + threshold" elements):
  — Boundary: Explicit intra-city boundary or core area terminology appears, such as city walls/moats, (inner/outer) city, old city/old city district, core area, (first/second/third) ring road, inner/outer ring, city's eight districts, old three districts/six districts, specific county/street/district lists, etc.
  — Threshold: Paired with exclusive phrasing like "only recognize/only counts if/must/inside/outside/inside counts/outside doesn't count," expressing the meaning "counts if inside the boundary/doesn't count if outside."
○Positive Examples:
  — "Only inside the Second Ring counts as Beijinger," "Only recognize the old three districts as locals," "Only inside the moat counts as indigenous."
○Negative Examples (should be classified into other categories, not this one):
  — Only saying "living in the urban area/city/locality/a certain district" without expressing boundary threshold (→ 1.1 Current Residence).
  — "Grew up locally/born and raised" (→ 1.2 Birth and Upbringing).
  — "Local hukou/ID card/household registration" (→ 1.3 Administrative or Legal Recognition).
  — "Ancestors/generations in the city/old Beijinger/Weitou" (→ 1.4 Family Heritage).

2. Socio-Cultural & Psychological Criteria
Judgment Guideline: This category is ordered by the depth of individual integration, from the most basic self-awareness to final community acceptance.

●2.1 Self-Identification
○Covers the individual's cognitive definition and declaration.
○The core question is: "If you consider yourself a local, then you are one?"

●2.2 Sense of Belonging
○Covers the individual's emotional connection and loyalty to the city, a deeper level than mere self-positioning.
○The core question is: "Does a person truly consider this city home from the bottom of their heart?"

●2.3 Linguistic Ability
○Covers mastery and use of the local dialect. This is a key skill for individuals actively integrating into the cultural circle.
○Includes: ability to understand, ability to speak, authenticity of accent.

●2.4 Cultural Practices & Knowledge
○Covers deeper cultural characteristics, beyond language, that individuals acquire and demonstrate.
○Includes: lifestyle habits (diet, consumption), behavioral etiquette (manners, style), cultural knowledge (local memory).

●2.5 Community Acceptance
○Covers whether the individual is perceived, recognized, and accepted as "one of us" by the local community, the ultimate manifestation of integration.
○Judgment criteria include:
■Intuition and temperament judgment: Whether one is considered to have the overall "feel" or "temperament" of a local (e.g., "can tell at a glance").
■Interpersonal network composition: Whether one has many local friends, whether one can integrate into local social circles.
